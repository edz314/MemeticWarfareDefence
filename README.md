Its purpose is to detect misinformation and alert users before they engage with or spread potentially harmful content.

**Features**
Multi-modal media analysis: Analyze text, images, videos, voice recordings, and more.
Real-time veracity checking: Process media streams in real-time with minimal delay.
Cross-reference with trusted sources: Verify information against a basket of sources like:
Wikipedia
Reputable news sites
Personal contacts
Prior conversations or context from the user
Flexible input: Can process media from various channels such as:
Inbound messages (e.g., WhatsApp, SMS)
Shared/forwarded media
Social media articles (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn)
Online shopping sites
Emails
